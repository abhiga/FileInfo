Project Name
	
	FileInfo (CloudShare Web application)


Project Description:
	
	FileInfo is a web application that lets users to share files anonymously 
	and securely among their friends. To access a file, user must know the 
	unique link of the file, which is only provided to the uploader when he
	uploads a file. This is implemented to make sure that these files can only 
	be accessed by users having permission from the uploader
	
	FileInfo also lets users to check what an extension of their file means, 
	and see what programs can open it. Users can drag and drop a file to the
	site, and it will recognize the extension, and will return a list of software
	that can open the file.


Future:

	We are thinking of extending the features of FileInfo in many ways:
	
	We are in the process of making the website to only allow an uploaded file
	to be downloaded a particular number of times, to avoid piracy.

	We are working on moving our database from Parse to MongoDB

	In future we will also come with support for user accounts to let users manage their
	files online.


Copyright:

	All the files uploaded to FileInfo are the the property of user (uploader). 
	We are not going to use it in any way. Also, we keep the right to delete any
	uploaded file in case we find it to be a copyrighted/objectionable material.
	
	FileInfo is not responsible for piracy of FILES.
